     * Extra care should be taken to never pass around the raw actor instance. It should always be used through an
     * {@link ActorRef}. Use the convention that when passing an actor as a method/constructor parameter to another
     * class, the type of the parameter is {@code ActorRef<TheActorInterface>}.
     * <p>
     * All actors bound to the same {@code ActorThread} will be executed in the same {@link Thread}, so it is OK for
     * them to share some mutable state when it is known that all the actors are bound to the same thread. A common
     * pattern is to pass an actor its own {@code ActorThread}, so that it can create short-lived actors for callbacks,
     * or a reference to itself, when communicating with other actors.
     * <p>
     * After nobody is holding the actor's {@link ActorRef}, that actor will be garbage collected. It is OK to create
     * lots of short-lived actors.
