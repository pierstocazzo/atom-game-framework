/**
 * MeshInterpolator - Usually refered as mesh morpher, morph between JME3's
 * Meshes or Geometries.
 *
 * <p>Take two mesh with the same (or near) topologies and morph between them
 * each verticles. For geometry, also two material are morphed.
 *
 * <p>To optimize the progess of computing Cage (the topology), the mesh morpher
 * will save the first computation or take it from the geometry custom data.
 *
 * <p>In TopoMesh a more sostiphicate topology extractor with wider usecases is
 * implemented.
