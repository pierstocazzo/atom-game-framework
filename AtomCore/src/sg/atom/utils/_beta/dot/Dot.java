/**
 * Dot is a simple functional declerative DSL : object navigation language.
 * Based in Limbo and simplier than OGNL. Dot2 has subsets of languages: Scala,
 * Haskell, Groovy, ELM to use in specific situation. It's very suite with the
 * polygot spirit of Atom framework.
 *
 * <h4>Concepts:</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Specification:</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Features:</h4>
 *
 * <h4>Implementation:</h4>
 *
 * <p>It use ANTRL to parse , StringTemplate to generate text, JavaAssist to
 * generate byte code on the fly.
 *
 * <p>Also has ELM capacities : functional reactive with additions like
 * alignment, localization. because it just contain numbers/names/operations and
 * a lot of dots(.) The different between Limbo and Dot is Dot include operation
 * for reactive extension: Dot arrow (.->) like in ELM.
