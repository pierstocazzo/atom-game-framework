/**
 * Flags a class as being deltable, meaning that it supports the creation of
 * delta objects that compactly represent a set of changes that may be applied
 * to an original object in order to create an updated object. Deltable classes
 * must have a no-argument constructor.
 *
 * <p> All non-
 * <code>transient</code> fields will be automatically included in the delta
 * generation process for a {@link Deltable} instance. Classes that wish to
 * customize the delta process should implement a method with the following
 * signature:
 *
 * <p><code>
 * public Delta createDelta ({@link Object} revised);
 * </code>
 *
 * <p> This method should return a {@link Delta} instance that, when applied to
 * an object identical to the object whose
 * <code>createDelta</code> method was called, will return an object identical
 * to
 * <code>revised</code>.
