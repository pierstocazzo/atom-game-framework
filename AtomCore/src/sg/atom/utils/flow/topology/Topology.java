 * Concept borrow from Storm. A topology is a graph of computation. Each node in
 * a topology contains processing logic, and links between nodes indicate how
 * data should be passed around between nodes.
 *
 * <p>In this topology the unit is not bolt but "only" OperationalTransform.
 *
 * <p>For mutli-node expansion, use Storm instead.
