/**
 * Defines the required operations that a conflict set should implement.
 * The conflict set is the place where the fireable rules are stored, and
 * one of them is to be chosen to fire at some moment.<br>
 * It's up to the implementing classes to determine the policy used to
 * select which rule to fire.<p>
 * The implementations of the conflict set must also be able to notify any
 * registered listener that some element has been added to or removed from
 * the conflict set.
 *
 * @version 0.03  08 Jun 2000    The conflict set is now a source of
 *                               <code>ConflictSetEvent</code>s.

 * @history 0.02  31 Mar 2000    The conflict set now stores ConflictSetElement
