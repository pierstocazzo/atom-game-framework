/**
 * ObjectiveStateManager is a pattern of "manager" who can capture the internal
 * "state" of its managed children and their transition between each other.
 *
 * <p>Read: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_object_classes.htm . Java
 * objects have states and behaviors.
 *
 * <p>State - object properties that marked as Stateful can be transformed,
 * mapped, converted and transfer to another object. Behavior marked as Stateful
 * can also be translated similarly by set the interpolated values. Underlying
 * this use a simple animator with premade primitive interpolators. For object
 * interpolation.
 *
 * <p>The same concepts seen in bean mapping(morph).
