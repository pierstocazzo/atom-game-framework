/**
 * The task master provides the ability for swing applications to invoke
 * tasks on another thread and to conveniently receive the results of
 * those tasks back on the swing event dispatch thread where the swing
 * application can safely manipulate its user interface in response to the
 * results of the task.
 *
 * <p/> Each task is run in it's own thread. Tasks are assumed to be
 * infrequently run and expensive, so the overhead of creating a new
 * thread to run each task is considered acceptable. If the need arises,
 * the task master can be extended to support more sophisticated thread
 * pooling but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
