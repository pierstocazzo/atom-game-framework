    Provides a mapping between JDBC tables and Java objects.

    <p> This is a hacked version of JORA 2.06, a library for automatically
      mapping RDBMS database rows to Java objects and vice versa. It's
      simple, it uses reflection and doesn't require any classfile
      post-processing or external configuration information.

    <p> "That's all great but why is it hacked?" wonders the astute
      reader. Well, I couldn't quite cope with the error handling paradigm
      that it used (catch all SQL exceptions internally and pass them to
      an application-wide error handler method) and a few seconds thought
      on the matter led me to believe that there is not a simple way to
      allow a choice of error handling paradigms (the methods have to
      throw SQLException or not). So I took the easy way out and forked
      the codebase.

    <p> The code is pretty stable, so I don't expect to be merging in
      updates with any frequency. I promise to be a good monkey and submit
      any useful modifications that I make back to the original
      maintainer. Fortunately the license was unrestrictive enough to
      allow me to do this, otherwise I'd probably be stuck reinventing the
      wheel or using something that does less of what I want. Three cheers
      for free software.

    <p> The JORA package was written by Konstantin Knizhnik and the
      original is available from
      <a href="http://www.ispras.ru/~knizhnik/">his web site.</a>
