What have we here?
------------------

This is a hacked version of JORA, a library for automatically mapping
RDBMS database rows to Java objects and vice versa. It's simple, it uses
reflection and doesn't require any classfile post-processing or external
configuration information.

"That's all great but why is it hacked?" wonders the astute reader. Well,
I couldn't quite cope with the error handling paradigm that it used (catch
all SQL exceptions internally and pass them to an application-wide error
handler method) and a few seconds thought on the matter led me to believe
that there is not a simple way to allow a choice of error handling
paradigms (the methods have to throw SQLException or not). So I took the
easy way out and forked the codebase.

The code is pretty stable, so I don't expect to be merging in updates with
any frequency. I promise to be a good monkey and submit any useful
modifications that I make back to the original maintainer. It's a good
thing that the license was unrestrictive enough to allow me to do this,
otherwise I'd probably be stuck reinventing the wheel or using something
that does less of what I want. Three cheers for free software.

The original version can be found here: http://www.ispras.ru/~knizhnik/
(or at least it could when I wrote this README).
