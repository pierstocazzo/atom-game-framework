/**
 * The repository class provides basic functionality upon which to build an
 * interface to a repository of information stored in a database (a table or set
 * of tables) that is accessed via JDBC.
 *
 * <p> It is expected that the repository class will encapsulate all database
 * access for a particular table or set of tables. The interface provided to the
 * rest of the application will involve only the application object model. For
 * example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class PeopleRepository extends SimpleRepository
 * {
 *     public Person getPerson (int personid);
 *     public Person[] getPeopleByFirstName (String firstName);
 *     public void updatePerson (Person person);
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p> It is probably also desirable to catch SQL exceptions and wrap them in
 * the
 * <code>PersistenceException</code> class that is provided by this package.
 *
 * <p> The repository comes in a few flavors depending on the needs of the
 * persistence services being developed:
 *
 * <ul> <li>{@link SimpleRepository}: The simple repository is used by services
 * that need access to a single JDBC connection to perform their database
 * operations.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link JORARepository}: JORA repository is used by services that wish to
 * make use of the JORA Java/RDBMS interoperability package.</li>
 *
 * <li> Because the repository provides a unified interface to a particular
 * persistence service, it is conceivable that it would need to talk to multiple
 * databases to provide those services. Presently, the repository only supports
 * a single connection, but if the need arose, implementing a repository flavor
 * that supported multiple connections would be the proper solution.</li> </ul>
